# Views Overview

Planner provides four powerful views built on Obsidian Bases.

## Available Views

| View | Best For |
|------|----------|
| [Calendar](calendar.md) | Scheduling, date-based planning |
| [Kanban](kanban.md) | Workflow management, status tracking |
| [Timeline](timeline.md) | Project visualization, Gantt-style |
| [Task List](task-list.md) | Bulk operations, filtering, sorting |

## How Views Work

All views are powered by **Obsidian Bases**, which means:

- Views query your vault for items with specific properties
- Changes in one view reflect everywhere
- Items are stored as markdown files with frontmatter
- You own your data

## Creating Views

When you click a ribbon icon, Planner creates a `.base` file in your vault:

- `Task List.base` - Task List view
- `Calendar.base` - Calendar view
- `Timeline.base` - Timeline view
- `Kanban.base` - Kanban view

## Customizing Views

Each view has configuration options accessible from the view's settings menu:

1. Open any view
2. Click the gear icon or view menu
3. Adjust options like grouping, coloring, and display

## Shared Features

All views support:

- **Click to Edit** - Click any item to open the Item Modal
- **Context Menus** - Right-click for quick actions
- **Refresh** - Manual refresh button for data updates
- **Responsive** - Works on desktop and mobile
