- Calendar View UI collapses upon itself when resizing window or clicking on a date to create a new item note or when deleting an item note.
- Resizing an all-day item in month or year view makes it disappear from the calendar.  Moving it works fine, though.
- Bases don't work.  Both show an error message: "Unable to parse your base file: Source contains mutiple documents; please use YAML.parseAllDocuments() at line 20, column 1: name: Table ---"
- Quick capture needs to put quotations around context items in list like `"@home"` instead of `@home`

- (**Wait to say this until **) Calendar view options are taking up too much real estate at the top
