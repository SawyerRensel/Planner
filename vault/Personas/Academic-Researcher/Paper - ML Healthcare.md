## Description

Research paper: "Improving Diagnostic Accuracy in Medical Imaging Using Federated Learning"

Target venue: Nature Medicine or JAMA

### Abstract Draft
We propose a federated learning approach for medical image analysis that preserves patient privacy while achieving state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy across multiple hospital systems...

### Key Contributions
1. Novel federated aggregation method for medical images
2. Privacy-preserving data augmentation
3. Multi-center validation study (5 hospitals)
